# Taylor'd Portfolio — TODO (remaining work)

The **granular checklist of what's left to build**. Completed milestones live in `MILESTONES.md`;
the high-level plan and backlog are in `ROADMAP.md`; the product spec is `SPEC.md`. See `CLAUDE.md`
→ "Working process" for how these fit together.

**How to use it:** work top-down. When you finish an item, check it off; when a whole milestone (or
sub-part) is done, **move its write-up out of this file into `MILESTONES.md`** and tick the matching
line in `ROADMAP.md`, in the same change. This file should only ever contain work that still needs
doing.

> **Current focus. v0.7.1 — bug fixes — COMPLETE and wrapped (2026-08-04).** All 18 verified defects fixed
> (Milestones A–H, write-ups in `MILESTONES.md`), `MARKETING_VERSION` bumped to **0.7.1**, and the v0.7.1
> summary added to `README.md`'s Version history. **Nothing is in progress** — the next version is unstarted;
> see "Next version" below for kickoff candidates.


Layer dependency rule still applies (Presentation → Business → Data → Infrastructure, imports point
down only).

# Next version — (unstarted; number + theme TBD)

**Nothing is scheduled** — v0.7.0 and **v0.7.1 (bug fixes) are both complete** (per-milestone record in
`MILESTONES.md`); the next version is unstarted.

**Milestones restart at Milestone A** (see the versioning note in `CLAUDE.md`). The number and theme aren't chosen
until development starts (see `CLAUDE.md` → "Never pre-name the next version"). At kickoff, pick a theme from
`ROADMAP.md`'s Backlog (native `LanguageModel` provider seam, on-device embedding RAG, optional MCP tools) or spec
a `PLANNED.md` entry — that file is **empty again** now that v0.7.1 has been scheduled out of it. Four candidates
are known but unspecced and each needs a `PLANNED.md` entry with a `Target:` first:

- **ATS-friendly export mode** — noted alongside v0.6.1: standard headings, single-column, selectable text, which
  is what decides whether an ATS can *parse* a résumé at all.
- **Chunked full tidy** — v0.6.2 Milestone E's follow-on: tidy a long document in segments so its readable copy is
  complete *and* formatted throughout, rather than tidied-then-raw.
- **Custom accent colours in the manager UI** — v0.7.0 models `LaTeXAccent.custom(hex:)` and it survives a
  round-trip, but Milestone E's picker offers only the bundled palette.
- **Cross-window style refresh** — a style saved in Settings doesn't reach an already-open Application window
  until it reloads (v0.7.0 E, accepted deliberately; generation presets behave the same). An
  `AppSession.dataChanged()` bump would fix both.

Assign the version number, bump `MARKETING_VERSION`, and break it into Milestone A, B, C… here.
